# RFC 2119 cheat sheet

A cheat sheet for using RFC 2119. Created in OmniGraffle 5.4.

# Motivation

I've seen lots of specifications that use [RFC 2119](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119) to indicate requirements levels, so when I needed to write my own, I decided to use it as well. But, I had trouble remembering all the terms and scrolling through the RFC was tedious, so I made a cheat sheet.

## Why OmniGraffle?

I made the cheat sheet in OmniGraffle, a closed-source piece of software, because I happened to have it around, and I knew I'd be accomplish what I wanted using it.

I used OmniGraffle version 5 because that's what I happen to have a license for.

I'm open to switching to a more-open format, but I haven't had time to learn another program and port the cheat sheet.
